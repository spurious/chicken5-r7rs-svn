NOTES

* "export" does not support "(rename ...)" specifier yet.
  - this needs extensions to the core module system.

* Redefinition of "import" causes "re-importing" warnings.
  - The warnings could be removed in core, it's usefulness is not completely clear.

* Just reexporting procedures (like from srfi-4) doesn't change their lambda-info names.
  - This is sort of confusing, do we care?
  - Also, this makes the locations from errors (from ##sys#check-whatever) wrong/misleading.

* Should bytevectors be implemented over blobs instead of srfi-4 (or something else)?

* get-environment-variable: "It is also an error to mutate the resulting string" ...
  - can we just ignore this?

* In R7RS parameter-values are not inherited from parent threads. This
  will require changes in core, possibly with some sort of backwards-compatibility mode.
